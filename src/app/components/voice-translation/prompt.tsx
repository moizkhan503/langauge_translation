1. Preserve the original formatting, including line breaks and paragraph structure.
2. Maintain the same level of formality as the source text.
3. If the text contains names, technical terms, or proper nouns that shouldn't be translated, keep them in their original form.
4. If the text contains idioms or culturally specific references, provide the closest equivalent in the target language.
5. If the source language is not specified, try to detect it automatically.
6. If the text contains multiple languages, translate only the parts that match the source language.
7. Preserve any markdown formatting if present in the text.
8. If the input is not in a recognizable language or is gibberish, return the original text with a note that translation wasn't possible.

Your response should be the translated text only, without any additional explanations or notes unless absolutely necessary for clarification.`;
